            <p>At the cat party of America, we take pride in our good looks, cute mews and dazzling tail flourishes.
                Our apartment is our oyster, and sometimes we go outside into the hallway.
                Because of our world experience and extreme photogenic abilties, we think that we are fit
                to lead you, humans, into the future.</p>
            <p>Join us in battle, or join us in snuggles. We're honestly good either way. So long you give us wet
                food, and clean out that god forsaken box. Like we're thankful you do it but why do you make us
                poop in a box? We could go outside and rid this place of those birds. The cat party is firmly against
                birds... despite one of us being named Bird. But it's a nickname, and her real name is Gertrude.</p>
            <p>Just whatever you do, please vote for us. We'd do really well fighting the birds and we understand that
                is also a top priority for American. Legalize bulk catnip. End the for-profit-shelter system.
                Free the strays and start a single payer veterinarian system for all cats! And a restitution fund
                for the families of the fallen veterinarians. Get the birds.
            </p>
            <p>Dog bless America!</p>
